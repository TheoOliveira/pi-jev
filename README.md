# pi-jev

Semantic tool routing and typed decisions for the [Pi coding agent](https://pi.dev) powered by [TypeSafe](https://typesafe.ai) Jev (System One).

## Features

- **Semantic Tool Router (`jev_find_tools`)**: Automatically searches registered inactive tools and additively activates only the tools needed for the user's specific prompt or workflow.
- **Skill Discovery (`jev_find_skill`)**: Semantically matches and suggests the most relevant specialized agent skills (`SKILL.md`) for any task without cluttering prompt context.
- **Typed Judgments (`jev_evaluate`)**: Run fast, calibrated System One decisions directly from the agent using Choice, Noul (yes/no probability), and Score primitives.
- **Dynamic Evaluations (`/jev test <prompt>`)**: The active model designs the Jev question schema for a free-form prompt, then Jev evaluates it.
- **Automatic Mode (opt-in)**: `--jev-auto` / `PI_JEV_AUTO=1` / `/jev auto on` routes tools and suggests skills before every prompt. Off by default.
- **On-Demand & Safe**: Runs when called. No unsolicited per-turn API token costs. Fails open gracefully to local keyword shortlists if Jev is unreachable or unconfigured.

## Installation

```bash
pi install npm:pi-jev
```

Or install directly from GitHub:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/TheoOliveira/pi-jev
```

## Setup

Set your TypeSafe API key via environment variable:

```bash
export TYPESAFE_API_KEY=ts_...
```

Or store it in Pi's secret store file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.pi/agent/secrets
echo "ts_..." > ~/.pi/agent/secrets/typesafe_api_key
```

Then check status inside Pi:

```text
/jev status
```

## Automatic Mode

Opt in to run one Jev routing pass before each agent turn (automatic mode costs one Jev request per prompt):

```bash
pi --jev-auto            # per-run CLI flag
export PI_JEV_AUTO=1     # persistent via environment
```

Toggle at runtime with `/jev auto on` or `/jev auto off` (no argument flips it). Automatic mode:

- activates inactive tools whose usefulness probability clears `JEV_THRESHOLD` (0.65);
- injects matching skill recommendations into the turn;
- skips slash commands, empty prompts, and prompts while Jev is unconfigured or already evaluating;
- never throws — a Jev failure leaves the turn untouched.

`JEV_THRESHOLD` (in `src/skills.ts`) is the one act/reject cutoff: raise it for precision, lower it for recall. Every path — router, tools, `/jev skills`, auto mode — reads that same constant.

## Commands

- `/jev status` — Shows Jev configuration (and where the API key came from), auto-mode state, session request count, total tokens, and available tool counts.
- `/jev help` — Lists available subcommands.
- `/jev skills [query]` — Discover and rank matching skills in the workspace using Jev.
- `/jev test [prompt]` — With no prompt, runs the fixed connectivity smoke test. With a prompt, the active model designs the Jev questions for that prompt and Jev evaluates them. Also accepts `/jev eval` and `/jev evaluate`.
- `/jev enable` — Enables Jev tools in the active session.
- `/jev disable` — Disables Jev tools for the active session.
- `/jev auto [on|off]` — Turns automatic per-prompt routing on or off (no argument flips it).

## Tools Provided

### 1. `jev_find_tools`
Used by the model to find capabilities that aren't currently loaded into the prompt prefix.

```json
{
  "query": "inspect SQLite database schemas and run queries"
}
```

### 2. `jev_find_skill`
Used by the agent to find relevant specialized workflows and instructions for complex tasks.

```json
{
  "query": "build accessible modal component in React"
}
```

### 3. `jev_evaluate`
Used for structured decisions, classifications, triage, and scoring.

```json
{
  "state": { "diff": "..." },
  "questions": {
    "is_breaking": {
      "type": "noul",
      "instructions": "Does this change introduce any breaking API changes?"
    }
  }
}
```

## Development & Testing

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm test
```
